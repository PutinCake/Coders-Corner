## Coders Corner 

This is an application for people who would like to get help with their coding(software development)
Skills.
A student can go to this application and check in to reach out to a mentor for help.
Students will have some possible sulotions(links to good resources) to read while they wait for
direct assistance from a mentor.
Mentors get to see students names and the topics they have problems with. 
If the mentor is fimiliar with the topic then they can click a button which will take the mentor to a 
private chatroom with the particular student.

## Tools Used:

* Javascript
* jQuery
* MDN API
* Mozilla API
* Anime.js
* AJAX calls for the above APIs


## Why it is useful:

2. Coders Corner solves that by giving both general results and peer to peer interaction to find a solution to your coding problems.

## Coders Corner 

This is an application for people who would like to get help with their coding(software development)
Skills.
A student can go to this application and check in to reach out to a mentor for help.
Students will have some possible sulotions(links to good resources) to read while they wait for
direct assistance from a mentor.
Mentors get to see students names and the topics they have problems with. 
If the mentor is fimiliar with the topic then they can click a button which will take the mentor to a 
private chatroom with the particular student.

## Tools Used:

* Javascript
* jQuery
* MDN API
* Mozilla API
* Anime.js
* AJAX calls for the above APIs


## Why it is useful:

1. Because Search services give you very general responses, it lacks with assisting you with specific 
   coding problems.
2. Coders Corner solves that by giving both general results and peer to peer interaction to find a 
   solution to your coding problems.
